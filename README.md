# Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms focuses on problem solving.

Foundations of programming are required.

# What are Data Structures?

Coding is just manipulating data in a way so that you can accomplish a task.

There are values and relationships between them.

We can remove, insert, and manipulate data.

Data Structures have different kinds of relationships and different ways of storing data.

Data structures are a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Data structures are categorized into two main types: primitive and non-primitive. Primitive data structures include basic types like integers, floats, and characters, while non-primitive structures, which are more complex, include arrays, lists, trees, and graphs.
