# Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms focuses on problem solving.

Foundations of programming are required.

# What are Data Structures?

Coding is just manipulating data in a way so that you can accomplish a task.

There are values and relationships between them.

We can remove, insert, and manipulate data.

Data Structures have different kinds of relationships and different ways of storing data.

Data structures are a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Data structures are categorized into two main types: primitive and non-primitive. Primitive data structures include basic types like integers, floats, and characters, while non-primitive structures, which are more complex, include arrays, lists, trees, and graphs.

# Complexity Analysis

The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. It is a measure of how much time and space an algorithm requires to run.

These are called time complexity and space complexity.

# Memory

Memory can be visualized as a canvas. Memory canvas is bounded. We have a finite amount of memory. Your program will store your variables in memory slots or a row of memory slots for related data e.g. arrays.

In a computer, memory is organized as a large number of bytes. Each byte is used to store value and has a unique address. The computer can perform read or write operations to these addresses.

Each byte has 8 bits. Each bit can be either 0 or 1. A bit is the smallest unit of memory. A byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory.

A memory block is a section of computer memory where each byte is right next to its neighbor, without any gaps or interruptions This arrangement makes it easier for the computer to read and write multiple pieces of related data.

You often use memory blocks for storing groups of data that belong together, such as the elements in an array or the characters in a string. By keeping them arranged like that, the computer can access and manage the data more efficiently.

Different computer architectures have different memory block sizes. For example, a 32-bit computer has a memory block size of 32 bits, or 4 bytes. A 64-bit computer has a memory block size of 64 bits, or 8 bytes. This means that e.g. numbers on a 32-bit computer are stored in 4 bytes, while numbers on a 64-bit computer are stored in 8 bytes. So the computer needs to find 4 bytes of free memory to store a number on a 32-bit computer, but 8 bytes of free memory to store a number on a 64-bit computer.

ASCII is a character encoding standard that assigns each character a number between 0 and 127. For example, the ASCII number for the character A is 65, and the ASCII number for the character B is 66. The ASCII number for the character 0 is 48, and the ASCII number for the character 9 is 57.

## Pointers

Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are used to store the addresses of other variables. So in memory, a pointer would be stored in a memory slot, and it would point to another memory slot.

## Computer accessing memory

Computer is able to access memory given a memory address very fast.
